bsg_ast_always_at_redux_opt_inplace.py

This optimization pass will go through all of the always at statements created
by converting SEQGEN cells to RTL and reduce the AST complexity. Primarily, it
is going to squash always blocks with the same sensitivity lists and merge if
statements within the always block that are based on the same conditions. It
also searches through all the non-blocking assignments in the block and combine
assignments for multi-bit buses. It does so by creating a large concat on the
left and right of the non-blocking assignment. After this pass, it is suggested
to run the concat_redux_pass_inplace optimization to reform buses in the
non-blocking assignments.

# ast_always_at_redux_opt_inplace( node )
#
# Main optimization pass. This will go through the whole AST and find always
# blocks from seqgen cells. It will combine sensitivity lists and if-statements
# within an always block. It will then try and reduce the block complexity
# inside each if-statement case by collapsing non-blocking assignments to the
# same bus into a single non-blocking assignment with a concat on the left and
# right to make for further optimization later (primarily from the
# concat_redux_pass_inplace).
